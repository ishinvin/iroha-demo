## Overview of Iroha

Hyperledger Iroha is a general purpose permissioned blockchain system that can be used to manage digital assets, identity, and serialized data. This can be useful for applications such as interbank settlement, central bank digital currencies, payment systems, national IDs, and logistics, among others.

## Key features of Iroha
- Simple deployment and maintenance
- Variety of libraries for developers
- Role-based access control
- Modular design, driven by commandâ€“query separation principle
- Assets and identity management

## How is it different from Bitcoin or Ethereum?
Bitcoin and Ethereum are designed to be permissionless ledgers where anyone can join and access all the data.

Iroha system interaction is permissioned, meaning that only people with requisite access can interact with the system. Hence, access to all the data can be controlled.

One major difference from Ethereum, in particular, is that Hyperledger Iroha allows users to perform common functions, such as creating and transferring digital assets, by using prebuilt commands that are in the system.
